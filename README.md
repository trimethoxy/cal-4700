although the author does not indicate any license for software, he does not
prohibit its distribution:

"There is no license. The source code has been published far and wide so there
is no need for a license, since anyone who wants can learn from it and use it as
he pleases, and -- if he has more time and money than I do -- will undoubtedly
win any legal suit I might be inclined to bring against such a one."

separate ed script, licensed under EUPL version 1.2, will be added to enable
users to apply changes to the original source code, required to port software to
GNU/Linux.
